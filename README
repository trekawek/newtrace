===   Summary   ===
Newtrace is a traceroute program written in Ruby. The extra feature of that
utility is displaying all network interfaces of each intermediate router.

===    Usage    ===
You have to run newtrace as a superuser, because it is sending ICMP packets.
Typical usage:
# ./newtrace.rb -n google.com

You can have some help typing:
# ./newtrace.rb -h

=== Description ===
For example:

/----\IF0  IF1a/-------\IF1b    IF2a/-------\IF2b   IF3/-----------\
|user|---------|Router1|------------|Router2|----------|destination|
\----/         \-------/            \-------/          \-----------/
TTL:               1                    2                    3

Standard traceroute command displays only IF1a, IF2a and IF3 interfaces.
Newtrace is trying to guess second interface IP address, for example IF1b.

We have three informations: we know IF2a IP addres, we know that IF1b and IF2a
are in the same subnetwork and that IF1b is on Router1. Because subnets between
routers are often small (eg. with mask /30 or /29), it's possible to check every
IP address in given subnetwork. Newtrace is checking these IP sending ICMP
packets with small TTL (eg. 1 when looking for IF1b). When some IP replies with
'echo response' then we know that it's the one from Router1 and it's IF1b. To
make sure, newtrace also compares IP identification fields in packets from
IF1a and IF1b - if the difference between identifiers is tiny (below 10) we
can be convinced that we've found the right IP address. Next similar test is
comparing the TTL in 'echo response' packets from IF1a and IF1b - they have
to be equal.
